Vehicle Counting and Classification (motorbike or car)
⚠️ Please pay attention to the following notes about the image to be processed:
☑ The size SHOULD be of moderate dimensions (around 1280x720).
☑ MUST have clean background.
☑ The objects (vehicles, things, etc) MUST stand apart at a distance.
-So, to test, please use the images I have prepared in the "testimg" folder. If you use another image, it will still work, but there is a possibility of inaccuracy. This is because I did not use a pre-trained model to detect the vehicle against the background; instead, I used image processing techniques. As a result, it may not be able to detect vehicles if the background is too complex or if the vehicles are not stand apart at a distance.
